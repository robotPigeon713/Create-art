# The code from the ipynb file addresses the setup of a conda environment, 
# as well as the training and evaluation of a convolutional neural network with two
# convolutional layers to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.
# Python version 3.10.19 and Tensorflow version 2.20.0
#
# Ensure enabled GPU usage for the Tensorflow library for faster processing: python3 -m pip install 'tensorflow[and-cuda]'
